I refused to contribute to StackOverflow a year ago.
Yeah, I still have peeked into the Gson tag [hole](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/gson) anonymously.
That was the power of the gamification I lived with almost a decade.
Okay, I never contributed heavily, however I wouldn't let myself post a stupid answer trying to put the best I can for those morons for free.
Yeah, that is.
Sometimes I posted under fictional names (see idontcare and no-one-cares users there if you want), because I had a feeling I had to make a post, probably being a gamification addict.
Come on, what's for?
I don't know, let it go away.
Recently I decided to [help out](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55286855/preventing-gson-from-converting-integers-to-decimals-when-deserializing-numbers) a [folk](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2648/d%C3%B3nal) with 120+K reputation.
Explaining why his deserializer is not invoked, why he's using a raw class and why it's wrong, referenced my own [PR](https://github.com/google/gson/pull/1290) to Gson addressing a similar issue, I got a negative reputation point.
After 20 minutes since I posted my answer, the OP posted my own PR calling it a feature released in Gson 2.8.5 (again, this is wrong and this is a stale PR not have yet been released).
OP, what's wrong with you?
I'll never post to StackOverflow anymore even anonymously leaving all the morons with their problems alone.
Fuck it.
